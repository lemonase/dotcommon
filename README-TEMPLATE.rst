dotcommon is a crawler that is built to answer questions
*What are the most common Bash aliases?*,
*What are the most common Vundle plugins for Vim?*, etc.
It searches GitHub for 1000 most recently edited configs
(to follow trends) and counts such things.

    Disclaimer: the project isn't run by a data scientist
    and the numbers below should be interpreted in the context
    provided above: *1000 most recently edited configs hosted on
    GitHub*. Make any further assumptions on your own risk.
    See `these slides`_ if you look for a serious research.
